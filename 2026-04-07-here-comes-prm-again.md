# Here comes PRM (again)

2026-04-07

## So what's this one all about ?

While a lot of folk were getting into the chocolates over the Easter weekend, AWS have released new support info and capabilities for their previously released Partner Revenue Measurement (PRM) efforts. The [onboarding/getting started guide is updated](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/PRM/latest/aws-prm-onboarding-guide/getting-started.html).

There's basically 2 changes:

* Adding support for Metering
* Adding support for User Agents

### Metering

If you publish Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) or Machine Learning (ML) products to marketplace, then Metering is an important part of PRM for you - and prior to this release, you didn't get much love. 

But now its easy - [you don't have to do anything to make it work!!](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/PRM/latest/aws-prm-onboarding-guide/marketplace-metering-implementation.html) - essentially if you are publishing EC2 AMIs or Sagemaker AI ML models, you're already hooking the metering API when they are purchased and provisioned, and that data flows into PRM.

### User Agents

Perhaps the most notable addition is support for User Agent tagging of API/CLI calls as a partial alternative to Resource tagging. There's only a [subset of services currently supporting the PRM UA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/PRM/latest/aws-prm-onboarding-guide/user-agent-included-services.html), so there's still a gap between Resource-taggable and User Agent-taggable services and the possible total set of AWS services that could make up a workload which is tracked for PRM purposes. 

The HOW-TO part is pretty easy if you have some AWS technical experience:

1. Get the product code from the AWS Marketplace Management Portal.

2. Create the User Agent string using the format ```APN_1.1/pc_<YOUR-PRODUCT-CODE>$```. (Don't trim the ```$```; its not a typo).

3. Now here comes the hand-wavy bit - "update your AWS SDK Configuration to include the User Agent string". Lets assume you are at least going to experiment with the CLI and have an IAM user that has the right permissions so you can aws login without an error:

```
# Set user-agent string for AWS CLI
export AWS_SDK_UA_APP_ID="APN_1.1/pc_xxxxxxxxxx$"

# Example EC2 API call with user-agent
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-xxxxxxxxxx --instance-type t2.micro --region us-east-1
```

Check with your engineering folks that look after infrastructure as code as to how this needs to be embedded with your build/deployment process. If you have a complex product, or multiple products, you're going to need to build this in a few times, and if this all seems complicated, we're [happy to help]().

4. Check it worked

```
# Check CloudTrail logs for user-agent string
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name CloudTrail/YourLogGroup \
  --filter-pattern "APN_1.1" \
  --start-time 1641395200000
```

you should see something like this:


```
  "eventName": "RunInstances",
  "eventSource": "ec2.amazonaws.com",
  "userAgent": "APN_1.1/pc_xxxxxxxxxx$ aws-cli/2.0.0",
  "sourceIPAddress": "42.32.106.19",
  "resources": [
    {
      "accountId": "123456789123",
      "type": "AWS::EC2::Instance"
    }
  ]
}
```


## The wrap up

There are more than a few wrinkles, but still, the addition of User Agents helps close some gaps and provide some alternatives to the problems of using Resource tagging as we wrote about and experimented with earlier. Now if only AWS will release some kind of PRM dashboard that supports both Resource and User Agent tagging for partners, it will almost make sense.
