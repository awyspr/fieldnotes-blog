# AgentMode under the microscope

2026-04-27

## What's this one all about then ?
We've been working a bit with the [AWS Marketplace AgentMode feature](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/aws-marketplace-agent-mode-ai-enhanced-search/) recently. Its well-enough designed - compare a few specific products that come up in a search list or upload some requirements and find what matches and then dovetail into a proposal and agreement process process. Whether or not a buyer would be convinced to shortlist and or even choose a solution purely on the basis of AgentMode's analysis is a different question - its probably useful for market research.

### Observations
Four things stick out a bit funny with AgentMode from our testing.

1) AgentMode can compare a maximum of 5 products (this is a constraint of how many product IDs you 
can shove onto the end of a URL like ```https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/agentmode/#/?agent=comparison&listingIds=```). 
ow this in itself isn't all that strange, a buyer does typically triage to a short list for a deeper dive. 
But its problematic if you got to AgentMode from some kind of a search with an AI overview and there were say 
100 results and maybe 10-15 of them were analysed by the AI overview feature. You're forced to break them up 
into groups, you can't do an N-way comparison of a list longer than 5. Maybe with a logged in user they could allow 
a list of 10 ?

2) AgentMode seems blissfully unaware when you ask it to compare things that are very different (and 
are unlikely to be compared in the real world): I'd like to compare an apple, a temple and a boat.  Perhaps 
extreme but you can tell AgentMode to compare some very unlikely things, like a service to help AWS partners GTM, 
a security ISV product, and an financial markets capital optimization platform:

AgentMode tries hard to make a comparison. Probably too hard - is that sycophantic AI ? And the comparison isn't all 
that helpful. A guardrail that did some kind of "are these even in the same broad category and therefore can be 
legitimately compared" would probably be useful, even if that was just saving production inferencing costs for AWS 
themselves or preventing DDoS type overloads from people hitting up AgentMode with malicious payloads (ahem! don't 
repeatedly hit that URL for fun).

3) it takes quite a long time to get a full comparison, and if you decide to leave early, you'll end up with tabulated 
empty comparisons (this is an issue both with the table on the web which actually progressively but slowly fills - 
you might have to make a coffee or hit refresh a few times to encourage it, as well as an issue with downloading PDF/CSV 
which is an interim semi-empty state unless the table itself has been completely filled by the AgentMode researcher). 

Here's some time-lapse screenshots of a reasonable comparison, focusing on the tabulation panel which ultimately 
brings the comparison together for a user:

EXAMPLE - timer 30 sec, 60 sec, 120 sec, 180 sec.

4) the AgentMode "evidence" in the form of its category/feature analysis and evidence is ... questionable. The 
researcher seems to grab highly rated over highly relevant/authoritative URLs and use those to make assessments, 
even when there is more structured detail in the marketplace entries themselves, and when the sources are potentially 
biased (eg one vendor writing an "objective" review of products in its space and selectively comparing them against 
itself to make a point). 

EXAMPLE

The linkages/reference embedding is not awesome either, but at least you're getting some evidence for the AgentMode's 
conclusions (which is better than some agentic marketplaces where there's a bare recommendation of a solution with 
no justification or traceability).

### Sideways Glances

Also apparently AgentMode is caching or cookie-fying what you do in the browser, because your comparison sessions 
persist in the project space (```https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/agentmode/#/project/proj-```) for some period. 
You can't re-run them but you can edit them or add extra requirements - that feels a bit odd too, or if you were 
doing that you'd want to keep the original version and make a modified copy.

In its current form, AgentMode is really AI content analysis, not agentic interaction - while you can poke 
AgentMode via a carefully constructed URL, its not neatly wrapped as a service (and isn't under MCP either). 
To join the dots for agentic commerce, a few more pieces need to be linked up - its probably good that they're 
kept separate at this point or agents might just buy random things and put them on your AWS bill.

## The wrap up

AgentMode is still a fairly new feature of AWS Marketplace and no doubt it will be improved and extended over 
time. Still, at this point it seems hard to believe that a buyer with an AWS account would search Marketplace, 
then approach AgentMode for a comparison or for extended requirements analysis, review its outputs, and on the 
basis of that step into a contract forming process (whether public or private offer).  Perhaps in a agentic 
commerce world that might be more likely, but for now, AgentMode seems like a convenient supporting/secondary analysis 
over a direct decision influence.
