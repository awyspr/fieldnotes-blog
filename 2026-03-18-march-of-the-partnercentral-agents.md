# The march of the PartnerCentral Agents

2026-03-18

## What's this one all about then ?

AWS announced the [arrival of agents in Partner Central](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/introducing-aws-partner-central-agents/).

What was surprising about this is that it wasn't a re:invent thing a few months back, but given that PartnerCentral Agents
land in the new PartnerCentral (v3.0, in Console), they probably needed to get that out first and allow some soak time before
unleashing agents.

### Embedded Experience

To be honest, its really just bringing some of the features of Agents in Console (aka Q) that have been around for quite a while
into/onto the PartnerCentral surface, and giving them some service targeted training material.

A few things they can do:
- update opportunities (creating not so awesome, since they pretty much drop into the form based registration flow, but updating can be done by chat)
- building analyses over pipeline (with more flexibility than Partner Analytics feature set, but accessing the same data)
- suggesting next steps for opportunities including engagement and funding and linking in other partners

Hot feedback is:
- if you know what you're doing in PartnerCentral, then often PartnerCentral Agents will feel slower (especially since
they project chain-of-thought into the browser session)
PartnerCentral Agents are ephemeral - they don't persist data between sessions so it can feel like taking to a goldfish
- if asking for next steps, the responses are very AWS prescriptive and maximalist (here is everything you might ever wanted to know ... some of it even relevant)

tl;dr - some things are probably going to be faster by hand, even faster by API, than by chat. But for less experienced users
coming to PartnerCentral, particularly those that are AI-native SDR/BDR/AEs, it should feel more aligned with the experiences
they are seeing in other GTM stacks.

### MCP hooks

The other part of PartnerCentral Agents is that they are [able to be invoked externally via MCP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/partner-central/latest/APIReference/partner-central-mcp-server.html).

This gets more interesting, because that means that external systems eg CRMs and similr things can pull back PartnerCentral 
Agent analysis and advice and merge it with their own data to form richer pictures or more nuanced action recommendations outside
of the PartnerCentral environment. Since most partners hold more comprehensive pictures regarding their pipeline outside of 
PartnerCentral, this should be a win.

## The wrap up

Now they have arrived, PartnerCentral Agents won't be getting rolled back anytime soon. If they're developed a bit more (eg memory, shared context,
looping/automation) they will certainly earn their place, and perhaps allow AWS to shift to a more self-service rather than self-configure experience.
